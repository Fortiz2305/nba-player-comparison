# NBA Player Comparison Web Application Specification

## Overview
The application allows users to compare NBA players based on their stats and find similar players using algorithms like K-nearest neighbors. It also provides features for player clustering and data exploration.

## Features
1. Player Selection
Dropdown menu with search functionality for selecting players.
Ability to select multiple players for comparison.

2. Player Comparison
Display player stats and similarity scores using radar charts and bar graphs.
Toggle between different visualization types.

3. Data Exploration
Predefined player and team clusters.
Interactive elements for detailed insights on stats and similarity scores.

4. Navigation
Simple navigation menu or sidebar for accessing features like player comparison and team clustering.

5. Responsive Design
Ensure the application is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.

## Architecture
1. Frontend
Framework: React
Charting Library: Chart.js or Recharts
Styling: CSS-in-JS using styled-components or Emotion
State Management: React Context or Redux
2. Backend
Data Storage: Initially CSV files, with plans to migrate to a SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL).
Data Processing: Precompute similarity scores and clusters to optimize performance.
API
Develop RESTful APIs to serve player data, similarity scores, and cluster information to the frontend.
Data Handling
Data Source: CSV files containing player stats.
Data Migration: Plan to migrate data to a SQL database for better performance and scalability.
Data Processing: Use Python or a similar language for precomputing similarity scores and clusters.
Error Handling
Frontend: Implement error boundaries in React to catch and display user-friendly error messages.
Backend: Use try-catch blocks and logging to handle and record errors. Return meaningful error messages to the frontend.

## Testing Plan
1. Unit Testing
Use Jest and React Testing Library for testing React components.
Test individual functions and algorithms for data processing.
2. Integration Testing
Test API endpoints using a tool like Postman or Supertest.
Ensure data flows correctly between the frontend and backend.

3. End-to-End Testing
Use Cypress or Selenium to simulate user interactions and verify the application works as expected.

4. Performance Testing
Test the applicationâ€™s performance under different loads to ensure it can handle multiple users.

## Deployment
Hosting: Consider using a cloud platform like AWS, Heroku, or Vercel for hosting the application.
CI/CD: Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
